        New York City, over five thousand young adults are taken in to custody by
        the city\u2019s department of juvenile justice. (Fenster-Sparber, 2008). While
        in detention, they do not have easy access to books, and literacy is not always
        a priority. Although attempts have been made to incorporate library sites
        throughout New York City\u2019s juvenile correctional facilities, students
        there have limited access to educational materials. Research shows that a
        higher literacy rate in such facilities can play a vital role in an incarcerated
        teen\u2019s rehabilitation process. The New York Public Library (NYPL) saw
        an opportunity to reach students who might otherwise not be able to get access
        to information and build a long-lasting outreach program with Passages Academy,
        a multi-site correctional school run by New York City\u2019s Department of
        Education and the Department of Juvenile Justice. This case study describes
        New York Public Library\u2019s mission at Passages Academy, which started
        shortly after Passages was established in 1998 and continues to be a strong
        community partner today. The author, who also participated in the project,
        interviewed NYPL librarians and Passages Academy librarians and educators
        to gain a better understanding of their challenges.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018\/978-1-61350-387-4.ch011","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,11]],"date-time":"2012-01-11T10:38:30Z","timestamp":1326278310000},"page":"140-147","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["A

        chapter describes the present conditions of our aging society, with a particular
        focus on Japan as a typical example of such a society. In Japan, one in every
        four individuals is over 65 years of age, and one in eight is over 75 years
        of age. Further, based on this demographic change to an older population,
        this chapter discusses a new library service designed to enhance the lives
        of elderly citizens. The authors explore this new service from the viewpoint
        of lifelong learning, utilizing the results of recent government surveys and
        some case studies, such as those done at the Izumo City Hikawa Library and
        the Akita Prefectural Library in Japan. Although the elderly have been placed
        within the category of \u201cdisabled library patrons,\u201d in recent years,
        it has become more common to consider the elderly, as a whole, as an individual
        service category. We should, in the near future, pay more attention to supporting
        elderly citizens at public libraries to engage them in the development and
        maintenance of their own communities. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018\/978-1-4666-5158-6.ch015","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,21]],"date-time":"2014-01-21T19:50:33Z","timestamp":1390333833000},"page":"266-283","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["The
