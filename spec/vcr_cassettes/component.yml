        New York City, over five thousand young adults are taken in to custody by
        the city\u2019s department of juvenile justice. (Fenster-Sparber, 2008). While
        in detention, they do not have easy access to books, and literacy is not always
        a priority. Although attempts have been made to incorporate library sites
        throughout New York City\u2019s juvenile correctional facilities, students
        there have limited access to educational materials. Research shows that a
        higher literacy rate in such facilities can play a vital role in an incarcerated
        teen\u2019s rehabilitation process. The New York Public Library (NYPL) saw
        an opportunity to reach students who might otherwise not be able to get access
        to information and build a long-lasting outreach program with Passages Academy,
        a multi-site correctional school run by New York City\u2019s Department of
        Education and the Department of Juvenile Justice. This case study describes
        New York Public Library\u2019s mission at Passages Academy, which started
        shortly after Passages was established in 1998 and continues to be a strong
        community partner today. The author, who also participated in the project,
        interviewed NYPL librarians and Passages Academy librarians and educators
