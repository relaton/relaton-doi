        analyzed data on spring and summertime larval and juvenile fish distribution
        and abundance in the upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE), California between
        1995 and 2001. The upper SFE includes the tidal freshwater areas of the Sacramento\u2013San
        Joaquin Delta downstream to the euryhaline environment of San Pablo Bay. The
        sampling period included years with a variety of outflow conditions. Fifty
        taxa were collected using a larval tow net. Two common native species, delta
        smelt &lt;em&gt;Hypomesus transpacificus &lt;\/em&gt;and longfin smelt &lt;em&gt;Spirinchus
        thaleichthys&lt;\/em&gt;, and four common alien taxa, striped bass &lt;em&gt;Morone
        saxatilis&lt;\/em&gt;, threadfin shad &lt;em&gt;Dorosoma petenense&lt;\/em&gt;,
        gobies of the genus &lt;em&gt;Tridentiger&lt;\/em&gt;, and yellowfin goby
        &lt;em&gt;Acanthogobius flavimanus&lt;\/em&gt;, were selected for detailed
        analysis. Outflow conditions had a strong influence on the geographic distribution
        of most of the species, but distribution with respect to the 2 psu isohaline
        (X2) was not affected. The distribution patterns of delta smelt, longfin smelt,
        and striped bass were consistent with larvae moving from upstream freshwater
        spawning areas to downstream estuarine rearing areas. There were no obvious
        relationships of outflow with annual abundance indices. Our results support
        the idea of using X2 as an organizing principle in understanding the ecology
        of larval fishes in the upper SFE. Additional years of sampling will likely
        lead to additional insights into the early life history of upper SFE fishes.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.47886\/9781888569599.ch4","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,5]],"date-time":"2021-01-05T05:02:53Z","timestamp":1609822973000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Early

        San Francisco Estuary is critical habitat for delta smelt &lt;em&gt;Hypomesus
        transpacificus&lt;\/em&gt;, a fish whose abundance has declined greatly since
        1983 and is now listed as threatened. In addition, the estuary receives drainage
        from the Central Valley, an urban and agricultural region with intense and
        diverse pesticide usage. One possible factor of the delta smelt population
        decline is pesticide toxicity during vulnerable larval and juvenile stages,
        but pesticide concentrations are not well characterized in delta smelt spawning
        and nursery habitat. The objective of this study was to estimate the potential
        exposure of delta smelt during their early life stages to dissolved pesticides.
        For 3 years (1998\u20132000), water samples from the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin
        Delta were collected during April\u2013June in coordination with the California
        Department of Fish and Game\u2019s delta smelt early life stage monitoring
        program. Samples were analyzed for pesticides using solid-phase extraction
        and gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry. Water samples contained multiple
        pesticides, ranging from 2 to 14 pesticides in each sample. In both 1999 and
        2000, elevated concentrations of pesticides overlapped in time and space with
        peak densities of larval and juvenile delta smelt. In contrast, high spring
        outflows in 1998 transported delta smelt away from the pesticide sampling
        sites so that exposure could not be estimated. During 2 years, larval and
        juvenile delta smelt were potentially exposed to a complex mixture of pesticides
        for a minimum of 2\u20133 weeks. Although the measured concentrations were
        well below short-term (96-h) LC50 values for individual pesticides, the combination
        of multiple pesticides and lengthy exposure duration could potentially have
        lethal or sublethal effects on delta smelt, especially during early larval
        development.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.47886\/9781888569599.ch15","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,5]],"date-time":"2021-01-05T05:02:53Z","timestamp":1609822973000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Early
