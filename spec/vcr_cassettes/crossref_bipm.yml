        was published under an unusual type of contract in which contributors, rather
        than receiving a one-time payment at the beginning, would continue to receive
        payments for every ten thousand copies sold. Overall, these studies show the
        variety of ways in which feminists tried to get around the \u201ctaint\u201d

        publishing at Oxford University Press included those titles aimed at a broader
        audience, including general non-fiction, illustrated histories and encyclopedias,
        World\u2019s Classics, and children\u2019s books. Originally a separate operation
        of the London Business, overseas trade publishing later devolved to the branches
        while domestic trade titles were amalgamated into the Oxford academic lists.
        Trade titles involved a higher level of risk, deeper discounts to booksellers,
        larger author royalty payments, and investment in marketing and sales. The
        Press gradually minimized these risks by introducing greater oversight from
        the Delegates on manuscript selection, and by reducing the number of individual
        titles and concentrating on series. The chapter highlights the significant
        series and individual trade titles from across the Press, and considers the
        trade list both in its interaction with OUP\u2019s wider academic and scholarly
        interests and within the context of commercial trade publishing.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/acprof:oso\/9780199574797.003.0012","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,22]],"date-time":"2017-06-22T08:16:57Z","timestamp":1498119417000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Trade

        this strength that the Press developed interests in reference, educational,

        developments in universities and the economics of the academic publishing
        sector. The influence of individual editors and senior management is also

        the appearance of computers in the classroom, fluctuations in state funding
