        identification of benthic habitat is based, in part, on its underlying geologic
        character. While some geologic characteristics can be inferred through bathymetry
        and remotely sensed imagery, knowledge based on actual sampling of the seabed,
        either through cores or through photography, can be expensive to collect,
        and in the latter case, difficult to quantify and assess. Hundreds of thousands
        of sediment cores, photographs, and videos have been collected along the continental
        shelves of the United States, in very large and very small research efforts,
        for various purposes and using a variety of equipment. We unify these sets,
        both numerical lab-based data and word-based data from from core logs, photos,
        and videos, where we apply fuzzy set theory to parse values from graphed meanings.
        These quantified combined data are mined for information useful for geologists,
        biologists, and ecologists into an linked information system, usSEABED, mappable
        in GISs and queriable in RDBs. We present a ever-growing integrated look at
        the character of the surficial seabed of the United States (to about 100m
        depth, where available) that includes textural information, degree of hardness,
        presence of biota, basic chemistry, and critical shear strength, to name a
        few. While these data are useful in their own right, most data held within
        usSEABED are available as baselines for habitat identification and assessment,
        or in combination with oceanographic, biologic, or geophysical data to a more
        complete understanding of a variety of critical processes necessary for effective

        Santa Ana River basin is the largest stream system in Southern California
        and includes a densely populated coastal area. Extensive urbanization has
        altered the geomorphology and hydrology of the streams, adversely affecting
        aquatic communities. We studied macroinvertebrate and periphyton assemblages
        in relation to two categorical features of the highly engineered hydrologic
        system\u2014water source and channel type. Four water sources were identified\u2014natural,
        urban-impacted groundwater, urban runoff, and treated wastewater. Three channel
        types were identified\u2014natural, channelized with natural bottom, and concrete-lined.
        Nineteen sites, covering the range of these two categorical features, were
        sampled in summer 2000. To minimize the effects of different substrate types
        among sites, artificial substrates were used for assessing macroinvertebrate
        and periphyton assemblages. Physical and chemical variables and metrics calculated
        from macroinvertebrate and periphyton assemblage data were compared among
        water sources and channel types using analysis of variance and multiple comparison
        tests. Macroinvertebrate metrics exhibiting significant (&lt;EM&gt;P &lt;\/EM&gt;&lt;
        0.05) differences between water sources included taxa and Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera
        richness, relative richness and abundance of nonchironomid dipterans, orthoclads,
        oligochaetes, and some functional-feeding groups such as parasites and shredders.
        Periphyton metrics showing significant differences between water sources included
        blue-green algae biovolume and relative abundance of nitrogen heterotrophic,
        eutrophic, motile, and pollution-sensitive diatoms. The relative abundance
        of trichopterans, tanytarsini chironomids, noninsects, and filter feeders,
        as well as the relative richness and abundance of diatoms, were significantly
        different between channel types. Most physical variables were related to channel
        type, whereas chemical variables and some physical variables (e.g., discharge,
        velocity, and channel width) were related to water source. These associations
        were reflected in correlations between metrics, chemical variables, and physical
        variables. Significant improvements in the aquatic ecosystem of the Santa
        Ana River basin are possible with management actions such as conversion of
        concrete-lined channels to channelized streams with natural bottoms that can
        still maintain flood control to protect life and property.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.47886\/9781888569735.ch15","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,5]],"date-time":"2021-01-05T15:22:10Z","timestamp":1609860130000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Effects

        sonar and multibeam imagery of Glacier Bay, Alaska, revealed complex iceberg
        gouge patterns at water depths to 135 m on the floor of Whidbey Passage and
        south to the bay entrance. These previously undiscovered gouges likely formed
        more than 100 years ago as the glacier retreated rapidly up Glacier Bay. Gouged

        gouges, probably due to increased habitat complexity. Small Pacific halibut
        were found more frequently in sedimentfree gouged areas, presumably due to
        higher prey abundance. In contrast, large Pacific halibut were found more
        frequently on soft substrates such as sediment-filled gouges, where they could

        &lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;As part of a strategy to reestablish native stocks
        of lake trout &lt;em&gt;Salvelinus namaycush&lt;\/em&gt;, six areas of offshore
        and coastal Lake Michigan benthic habitat were mapped with a bathymetric laser
        system. This allowed us to visualize and map morphologic detail by at least
        an order of magnitude over existing data. Decimeter elevation\u2013bathymetric
        data, referenced to the International Great Lakes datum of 1985, were obtained
        on a 4-m grid over a total area of about 200 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;\/sup&gt; in
        water depths from 0 to 30 m. Based on the laser-derived morphology, regional
        geology and sparse samples, three geologic regimes were used for substrate\u2013habitat
        classification: (1) bedrock carbonates of Silurian through Devonian age, indicated
        by bedding scarps and lineations at or near the surface at all of the mapped
        areas; (2) glacial deposits that appear as compacted clay till lineations
        and cobble and boulder moraines with outwash features; and (3) modern sand
        deposits seen in thin down-drift (to the east) bedforms, sand sheets, and
        depositional lobes. Preferred spawning substrate\u2014clean cobble and gravel
        deposits with adjacent deep water\u2014is present in sections of all mapped
        areas. However, laser data cannot discern cleanliness, and video data indicate
        the cleanliness on this substrate may be compromised by recent algal and mussel
        growth.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.47886\/9781888569605.ch15","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,14]],"date-time":"2021-02-14T18:18:10Z","timestamp":1613326690000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Benthic

        compromise the use of traditional reference-based study designs to evaluate
        the level of lotic impairment and establish restoration goals. Directly relating
        biological responses to the combined effects of urbanization is further complicated
        by the nonlinear response often observed in common metrics (e.g., Ephemeroptera,
        Plecoptera, and Trichoptera [EPT] species richness) to measures of human influence
        (e.g., percentage urban land cover). A characteristic polygonal biological
        response often arises from the presence of a generalized limiting factor (i.e.,
        urban land use) plus the influence of multiple additional stressors that are
        nonuniformly distributed throughout the urban environment. Benthic macroinvertebrates,
        on-site physical habitat and chemistry, and geographical information systems\u2013
        derived land cover data for 85 sites were collected within the 1,600-km2 Santa
        Clara Valley (SCV), California urban area. A biological indicator value was
        derived from EPT richness and percentage EPT. Partitioned regression was used
        to define reference conditions and estimate the degree of site impairment.
        We propose that an upper-boundary condition (factor-ceiling) modeled by partitioned
        regression using ordinary least squares represents an attainable upper limit
        for biological condition in the SCV area. Indicator values greater than the
        factor-ceiling, which is monotonically related to existing land use, are considered
        representative of reference conditions under the current habitat conditions
        imposed by existing land cover and land use.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.47886\/9781888569735.ch11","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,5]],"date-time":"2021-01-05T15:22:10Z","timestamp":1609860130000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Effects

        assessed the structure of periphyton, benthic macroinvertebrate, and fish
        assemblages and their associations with environmental variables at 17 sites
        on streams of the highly urbanized Santa Ana River basin in Southern California.
        All assemblages exhibited strong differences between highly urbanized sites
        in the valley and the least-impacted sites at the transition between the valley
        and undeveloped mountains. Results within the urbanized area differed among
        taxa. Periphyton assemblages were dominated by diatoms (&gt;75% of total taxa).
        Periphyton assemblages within the urbanized area were not associated with
        any of the measured environmental variables, suggesting that structure of
        urban periphyton assemblages might be highly dependent on colonization dynamics.
        The number of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Plecoptera (EPT) taxa included
        in macroinvertebrate assemblages ranged from 0 to 6 at urbanized sites. Benthic
        macroinvertebrate assemblages had significant correlations with several environmental
        variables within the urban area, suggesting that stream size and permanence
        were important determinants of distribution among the species able to survive
        conditions in urban streams. Only 4 of 16 fish species collected were native
        to the drainage. Fish assemblages of urbanized sites included two native species,
        arroyo chub &lt;em&gt;Gila orcuttii &lt;\/em&gt;and Santa Ana sucker &lt;em&gt;Catostomus
        santaanae, &lt;\/em&gt;at sites that were intermediate in coefficient of variation
        of bank-full width, depth, bed substrate, and water temperature. Alien species
        dominated urbanized sites with lesser or greater values for these variables.
        These results suggest that urban streams can be structured to enhance populations
        of native fishes. Continued study of urban streams in the Santa Ana River
        basin and elsewhere will contribute to the basic understanding of ecological
        principles and help preserve the maximum ecological value of streams in highly
        urbanized areas.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.47886\/9781888569735.ch16","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,5]],"date-time":"2021-01-05T15:22:10Z","timestamp":1609860130000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Effects
