        chapter studies American historical writing. In the United States, the legacy
        of the Progressive historians advocating a pragmatic study of the past in
        the interests of social and political usefulness was a powerful influence
        that continued to be evident after the Second World War. This Progressive
        agenda had flow-on effects that shaped other characteristics of American scholarship.
        One was recurrent but often misleading debates over conflict versus consensus
        on the issues of American national character, ideology, and politics; another
        was flexibility and innovation in interpretation, with receptiveness to new
        ideas derived from the influence of other humanities and the social sciences;
        still another was distrust of grand theory, and an instrumental and subordinate
        attention to historiography. The chapter then offers an outsider\u2019s view
        of American historiography from the vantage point of Australia, and with a

        chapter aims to re-examine the Chandlerian paradigm of the historical development
        of modern industrial enterprises in the United States by employing an analytical
        framework that comprehends the alternative models of corporate evolution,
        especially that of diversified business groups. Based on the systematic examination
        of the broad range of business groups that have historically developed in
        the United States, the chapter focuses on the two varieties of diversified
        business groups that historically played critical roles in that economy: those
        centered around overseas trading and operational firms; and those organized
        around banking institutions. It argues that diversified business groups played
        the characteristic roles of generating and reorganizing modern industrial
        enterprises to shape the contemporary economic landscape of oligopoly. Such
        roles played by the diversified business groups and their contributions to
        corporate and industrial development should be complemental to the Chandlerian
        multidivisional enterprises to configure the whole dynamics of the US economy

        of the Progressive historians advocating a pragmatic study of the past in
        the interests of social and political usefulness was a powerful influence
        that continued to be evident after the Second World War. This Progressive
        agenda had flow-on effects that shaped other characteristics of American scholarship.
        One was recurrent but often misleading debates over conflict versus consensus
        on the issues of American national character, ideology, and politics; another
        was flexibility and innovation in interpretation, with receptiveness to new
        ideas derived from the influence of other humanities and the social sciences;
        still another was distrust of grand theory, and an instrumental and subordinate
        attention to historiography. The chapter then offers an outsider\u2019s view
        of American historiography from the vantage point of Australia, and with a
        focus on the extra-academic life of American historians, including the development
        of \u2018public history\u2019.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780199225996.003.0024","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,18]],"date-time":"2018-01-18T17:58:17Z","timestamp":1516298297000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Historical

        chapter aims to re-examine the Chandlerian paradigm of the historical development
        of modern industrial enterprises in the United States by employing an analytical
        framework that comprehends the alternative models of corporate evolution,
        especially that of diversified business groups. Based on the systematic examination
        of the broad range of business groups that have historically developed in
        the United States, the chapter focuses on the two varieties of diversified
        business groups that historically played critical roles in that economy: those
        centered around overseas trading and operational firms; and those organized
        around banking institutions. It argues that diversified business groups played
        the characteristic roles of generating and reorganizing modern industrial
        enterprises to shape the contemporary economic landscape of oligopoly. Such
        roles played by the diversified business groups and their contributions to
        corporate and industrial development should be complemental to the Chandlerian
        multidivisional enterprises to configure the whole dynamics of the US economy
        in the long run.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780198717973.003.0014","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,19]],"date-time":"2018-04-19T08:09:52Z","timestamp":1524125392000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The
