        chapter studies American historical writing. In the United States, the legacy
        of the Progressive historians advocating a pragmatic study of the past in
        the interests of social and political usefulness was a powerful influence
        that continued to be evident after the Second World War. This Progressive
        agenda had flow-on effects that shaped other characteristics of American scholarship.
        One was recurrent but often misleading debates over conflict versus consensus
        on the issues of American national character, ideology, and politics; another
        was flexibility and innovation in interpretation, with receptiveness to new
        ideas derived from the influence of other humanities and the social sciences;
        still another was distrust of grand theory, and an instrumental and subordinate
        attention to historiography. The chapter then offers an outsider\u2019s view
        of American historiography from the vantage point of Australia, and with a

        chapter aims to re-examine the Chandlerian paradigm of the historical development
        of modern industrial enterprises in the United States by employing an analytical
        framework that comprehends the alternative models of corporate evolution,
        especially that of diversified business groups. Based on the systematic examination
        of the broad range of business groups that have historically developed in
        the United States, the chapter focuses on the two varieties of diversified
        business groups that historically played critical roles in that economy: those
        centered around overseas trading and operational firms; and those organized
        around banking institutions. It argues that diversified business groups played
        the characteristic roles of generating and reorganizing modern industrial
        enterprises to shape the contemporary economic landscape of oligopoly. Such
        roles played by the diversified business groups and their contributions to
        corporate and industrial development should be complemental to the Chandlerian
        multidivisional enterprises to configure the whole dynamics of the US economy

        chapter shows that predicaments facing the European Union today are reminiscent
        of constitutional decisions the United States faced not once, but twice. It
        begins with a simple expected present value model for government debt and
        explains how Hansen and Sargent (1980) used rational expectations econometrics
        to render this model operational. It then presents a case study that illustrates
        how the constitutions of the United States have influenced the government
        net-of-interest surplus process and therefore the value of government debt.
        Drawing on the unpleasant arithmetic of Sargent and Wallace (1981), the chapter
        argues that a responsible fiscal policy makes it easy for a monetary authority
        to sustain low inflation, whereas a profligate fiscal policy has the opposite
        effect.<\/p>","DOI":"10.23943\/princeton\/9780691158709.003.0010","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,21]],"date-time":"2017-11-21T12:51:26Z","timestamp":1511268686000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["United

        chapter considers the question of whether fascism was a realistic possibility
        in the United States during the Great Depression. It argues that federal and
        regional character of the American state, and of the American right, saved
        the United States from the emergence of an authoritarian political movement
        that sought anything but veto power at the seat of national government. But
        had the American state had more of a Prussian character, opposition to the
        New Deal order might well have taken a more overtly anti-parliamentary, paramilitary
        character, as it briefly did in the racially tense 1950s and 1960s, when resistance
        to integration generated a revival of rhetoric celebrating \u201cstates''
        rights,\u201d accompanied by sometimes violent clashes with federal authorities.<\/p>","DOI":"10.5406\/illinois\/9780252037856.003.0012","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,5]],"date-time":"2017-05-05T05:02:23Z","timestamp":1493960543000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The
