        the wake of its \"Caliphate\" declaration in 2014, the self-described Islamic
        State has been the focus of countless academic papers, government studies,
        media commentaries and documentaries. Despite all this attention, persistent
        myths continue to shape--and misdirect--public understanding and strategic
        policy decisions. A significant factor in this trend has been a strong disinclination
        to engage critically with Islamic State''s speeches and writings--as if doing
        so reflects empathy with the movement''s goals or, even more absurdly, may
        itself lead to radicalization.\nGoing beyond the descriptive and the sensationalist,
        this volume presents and analyses a series of milestone Islamic State primary
        source materials. Scholar-practitioners with field experience in confronting
        the movement explore and contextualize its approach to warfare, propaganda
        and governance, examining the factors behind its dramatic evolution from failed
        proto-state in 2010 to standard-bearer of global jihadism in 2014, to besieged
        insurgency in 2018. <italic>The ISIS Reader<\/italic> will help anyone--students
        and journalists, military personnel, civil servants and inquisitive observers--to
        better understand not only the evolution of Islamic State and the dynamics
        of asymmetric warfare, but the importance of primary sources in doing so.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780197501436.001.0001","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,17]],"date-time":"2020-09-17T06:37:02Z","timestamp":1600324622000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":10,"title":["The

        volume is the first to focus on teaching about Haiti\u2019s complex history

        between Haiti and the rest of the Caribbean, contributors provide pedagogical
        guidance on how to approach the country from different lenses in course curricula.

        stereotypes associating Haiti with disaster, poverty, and negative ideas of
        Vodou, going beyond the simplistic neocolonial, imperialist, and racist descriptions
        often found in literary and historical accounts. Instructors in diverse subject
        areas discuss ways of reshaping old narratives through women\u2019s and gender
        studies, poetry, theater, art, religion, language, politics, history, and
        popular culture, and they advocate for including Haiti in American studies
        and Latin American studies courses.\nPortraying Haiti not as \u201cthe poorest
        nation in the Western Hemisphere\u201d but as a nation with a multifaceted
        culture that plays an important part on the world\u2019s stage, this volume
        offers valuable lessons about Haiti\u2019s past and present related to immigration,
        migration, locality, and globality. The essays remind us that these themes
        are increasingly relevant in an era in which teachers are often called to
        address neoliberalist views and practices and isolationist politics.<\/p>","DOI":"10.5744\/florida\/9781683402107.001.0001","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,21]],"date-time":"2022-05-21T05:02:58Z","timestamp":1653109378000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Teaching

        at the heart of Haitian studies and Haiti\u2019s history. This edited volume
        calls into question the role of external actors in Haiti\u2019s sovereign
        affairs, while highlighting the ways in which Haitians continually enact their
        own independence and sovereignty. Chapters consider Haiti\u2019s sovereign
        roots and the contemporary encroachment on them by international actors, as
        well as the corresponding response, acquiescence, or resistance by Haitian
        institutions, including \u2018sovereignty from below\u2019 as wielded by grassroots
        organizations and religious ritual. Contributing authors consider how external
        actors and institutions have interacted historically with Haitian elites and
        government actors. Importantly, the volume examines parallel responses from
        historically marginalized urban and rural populations. The volume takes up
        issues long at the heart of Haitian studies and argues that otherwise disparate
        discussions of ownership and independence are in fact central to historical
        and contemporary considerations of Haiti and Haitians.<\/p>","DOI":"10.5744\/florida\/9780813062266.001.0001","type":"monograph","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,23]],"date-time":"2017-09-23T13:49:59Z","timestamp":1506174599000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Who

        One explores images and texts relating to the Haitian president-turn-emperor
        Faustin Soulouque that appeared in the British press. These representations
        contained meditations on the Haitian state and the newly-created Haitian Empire.
        Although they were produced and published in the British context, they reflect
        the concerns of interlocutors from across the Atlantic World, including the
        thoughts and words of observers based in the US, France and, of course, Haiti.
        Faustin Soulouque intervened explicitly in these Atlantic-wide discussions
        on the significance of the Haitian Empire by providing counter-representations.
        Such texts and images produced by the Haitian state, this chapter details,
        were received, read and interpreted in Britain to alter significantly ideas
        about Haiti. Concomitantly, the future relationship between British imperialism
        and people of African descent was questioned and made problematic.<\/p>","DOI":"10.3828\/liverpool\/9781800348226.003.0002","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,24]],"date-time":"2021-09-24T12:09:04Z","timestamp":1632485344000},"page":"37-86","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Representations
