        carnival offers a lens into popular power and politics. Political demonstrations
        in Haiti often manifest as musical performances. Studying carnival and political
        protest side by side brings insight to the musical engagement that ordinary
        citizens and celebrity musicians often cultivate and revere in contemporary
        Haiti. This book explores how the self-declared president of <italic>konpa<\/italic>
        Sweet Micky (Michel Martelly) rose to the nation\u2019s highest office while
        methodically crafting a political product inherently entangled with his musical
        product. It provides deep historical perspective on the characteristics of
        carnivalesque verbal play\u2014and the performative skill set of the artist
        (Sweet Micky) who dominated carnival for more than a decade\u2014including
        vulgarities and polemics. It moreover demonstrates that the practice of leveraging
        the carnivalesque for expedient political function has precedence in Haiti\u2019s
        history. Yet there has been profound resistance to this brand of politics
        led by many other high-profile artists, including Matyas and J\u00f2j, Brothers
        Posse, Boukman Eksperyans, and RAM. These groups have each released popular
        carnival songs that have contributed to the public\u2019s discussions of what
        civic participation and citizenship in Haiti can and should be. Author Rebecca
        Dirksen presents an in-depth consideration of politically and socially engaged
        music and what these expressions mean for the Haitian population in the face
        of challenging political and economic circumstances. <italic>After the Dance,
        the Drums Are Heavy<\/italic> centers the voices of Haitian musicians and
        regular citizens by extensively sharing interviews and detailed analyses of
        musical performance in the context of contemporary events well beyond the
        musical realm.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780190928056.001.0001","type":"edited-book","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,23]],"date-time":"2020-04-23T02:32:41Z","timestamp":1587609161000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["After

        Early Modern Drama Guides offer students and academics practical and accessible
        introductions to the critical and performance contexts of key Elizabethan
        and Jacobean plays. Essays from leading international scholars give invaluable

        blockbuster Tamburlaine plays (1587) instantly established Marlowe\u2019s
        reputation for experimenting with subversive, outrageous and immoral material.
        The plays follow the meteoric rise of a Scythian shepherd-turned-warlord,
        whose conquests of eastern emperors soon sees him established as the most
        powerful man in the world. The visual tableaux featured in the plays are iconic.
        He uses his enemy Bajazeth as a footstool, and has other emperors pull his
        chariot like horses. He burns the Qur\u2019an on stage. The plays were memorable,
        too, for how they sounded: they showcased the power and variability of iambic
        pentameter, the meter that Shakespeare would go on to perfect. No history
        of Shakespeare\u2019s theatre is complete without understanding the influence
        and significance of Marlowe\u2019s Tamburlaine plays.<\/JATS1:p>\n          <JATS1:p>Tamburlaine:

        book collects the central writings by Hans Blumenberg and covers topics such
        as on the philosophy of language, metaphor theory, non-conceptuality, aesthetics,
        politics, and literary studies. The book demonstrates Blumenberg''s intellectual
        breadth and gives an overview of his thematic and stylistic range over four
        decades. Blumenberg''s early philosophy of technology becomes tangible, as
        does his critique of linguistic perfectibility and conceptual thought, his
        theory of history as successive concepts of reality, his anthropology, or
        his studies of literature. The book allows readers to discover a master thinker
        whose role in the German intellectual post-war scene can hardly be overestimated.<\/p>","DOI":"10.7591\/cornell\/9781501732829.001.0001","type":"edited-book","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,23]],"date-time":"2021-01-23T14:43:39Z","timestamp":1611413019000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["History,

        Faustin Soulouque intervened explicitly in these Atlantic-wide discussions
        on the significance of the Haitian Empire by providing counter-representations.
        Such texts and images produced by the Haitian state, this chapter details,
