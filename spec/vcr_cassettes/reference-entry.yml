        chapter investigates the earliest printers in Oxford, from the first unknown
        printer of Rufinus'' commentary on the Apostolic Creed in 1478 and Theodoric
        Rood in the 1480s, through John Scolar in 1517, to Joseph Barnes, who benefited
        from a Supplicatio submitted to Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester and Chancellor
        of the University in c.1584, requesting support in obtaining royal permission
        formally to print books for the University. The careers and publications of
        these different printers are considered, both in a local and a wider European
        context, as are their differing relationships to the University itself. This
        \u2018prehistory\u2019 of university printing in the city of Oxford is further
        contextualized through an examination of publishing in other European university
        cities, particularly Venice, Paris, Cologne, and Leipzig, and of the impact
        of the wider book trade on printing in Oxford and on the University more generally.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/acprof:oso\/9780199557318.003.0002","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,21]],"date-time":"2014-08-21T09:31:12Z","timestamp":1408613472000},"page":"30-49","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Printing

        causes increased economic inequality, and the possibility of creating a more
