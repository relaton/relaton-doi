        affected, or were affected by, university governance, the revision and publication
        of university statutes, the changing composition of the Delegacy, and the
        University''s location in the broader political landscape. The significance
        of the Press''s income and expenditures for the University''s finances is
        discussed, with particular attention to the support for learned printing and
        to the changes in the management of the privilege. The chapter also examines
        the buildings of the Press, first the Sheldonian Theatre and later the Clarendon
        Printing House, in the context of the architectural and scholarly environment
        of the University of Oxford, with particular attention given to the influence
        of William Lancaster and George Clark, local patron of the architect Nicholas

        chapter surveys the works printed by the press for the University of Oxford.
        The book describes the published catalogues of the Bodleian Library and other
        collections in Oxford, an area of continual innovation and development in
        bibliography that assured the investment in new volumes would be matched by
        scholarly use and an enhanced reputation for the University. Thomas James,
        appointed Librarian in 1599, compiled the first printed catalogue of the Bodleian
        Library in 1605, and supplemented it with an alphabetical author catalogue
        in 1620; both were printed by the printers to the University. The chapter
        then describes the Press''s role as jobbing printer to the University, responsible
        for the production of various university announcements, statutes, and ceremonial
        programmes. The Press also printed a variety of non-scholarly works, including
        catalogues of graduates, schoolbooks, catechisms, keepsakes, and other ephemera;
        notable among these are the frequently reprinted Lily''s Grammar and Marshall''s
        Catechism.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/acprof:oso\/9780199557318.003.0010","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,21]],"date-time":"2014-08-21T09:31:12Z","timestamp":1408613472000},"page":"278-278","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The
