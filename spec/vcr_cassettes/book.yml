        chapter considers the relationship between printing and publishing and the
        University of Oxford by examining how the activities and reforms of the Press
        affected, or were affected by, university governance, the revision and publication
        of university statutes, the changing composition of the Delegacy, and the
        University''s location in the broader political landscape. The significance
        of the Press''s income and expenditures for the University''s finances is
        discussed, with particular attention to the support for learned printing and
        to the changes in the management of the privilege. The chapter also examines
        the buildings of the Press, first the Sheldonian Theatre and later the Clarendon
        Printing House, in the context of the architectural and scholarly environment
        of the University of Oxford, with particular attention given to the influence
        of William Lancaster and George Clark, local patron of the architect Nicholas
        Hawksmoor, in the progress and design of university buildings.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/acprof:oso\/9780199557318.003.0007","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,21]],"date-time":"2014-08-21T09:31:12Z","timestamp":1408613472000},"page":"158-191","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The
