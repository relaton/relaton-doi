        European social contract is possible\u2014if the discussion shifts from who
        has the right to act to who can help. Education is a striking example of Europe\u2019s
        paradox: the areas that interest its citizens most\u2014education, health,
        social protection\u2014are those where EU institutions have the least competence.
        Yet while the main policy responsibility and funding instruments are at national
        or regional level, the key global trends in education and the reforms they
        require call for a strong effort from both the EU and its member countries:
        an extraordinary expansion of the demand for higher education and new skills;
        a renewed interest in the interaction between technology, education, and society,
        driven by the advancement of data analysis and artificial intelligence; and
        a growing concern about the role of education in reducing inequality and social
        exclusion. Education has a great future\u2014but it will not be education
        as we know it; the credibility of Europe\u2019s social contract will rest
        on its capacity to build and communicate the case for change and to articulate
        a guiding vision for twenty-first-century learning.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780192895820.003.0004","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,17]],"date-time":"2021-11-17T17:36:35Z","timestamp":1637170595000},"page":"51-66","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Education
