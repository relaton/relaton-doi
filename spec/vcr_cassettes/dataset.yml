        chapter discusses the first manifestations of Islam in America from the eighteenth
        century to 1975. The first US Muslims were West African Sunnis who had been
        deported through the transatlantic slave trade. Most came from Senegal, Gambia,
        and Guinea. Despite being enslaved in a Christian land, they maintained their
        faith, and evidence shows that some continued to pray, fast, give charity,
        and follow a particular diet and dress code. Their literacy was well known
        and manuscripts they wrote in Arabic have been preserved. Part of their legacy
        can still be heard in American music. After their disappearance and without
        any evidence of continuity, indigenous movements, such as the Moorish Science
        Temple of Islam and the Nation of Islam, emerged in the early 1900s. Within
        their communities, created by and built around charismatic men, they mixed
        black nationalism, new definitions of identity, and pseudo-Islamic tenets,
        often in contradiction to the most basic principles of Islam. All these were
        used to bolster mental emancipation, self-determination, economic improvement,
        and social justice.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oxfordhb\/9780199862634.013.009","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,17]],"date-time":"2014-04-17T15:27:25Z","timestamp":1397748445000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        many personalities involved, and about the conflicts and concessions that

        the success of his richly illustrated Encyclopaedia of Cottage, Farm, and
        Villa Architecture and Furniture (1833), which is also reissued in this series,
        the landscape gardener John Claudius Loudon (1783\u20131843) received a great
        deal of correspondence from interested readers. This prompted him and the
        Encyclopaedia''s contributors to publish this supplement in 1842. Loudon and
        his colleagues had continued to study a range of rural buildings - from homes
        to farms and schools - in England and Scotland, while at the same time receiving
        architectural designs and detailed letters from North America and Australia.
        The supplement draws on this wealth of material to discuss developments in
        the use of building materials as well as innovations in design. The focus
        is on cottages, farms, pubs, schools and almshouses. Construction methods
        and furnishings are also discussed. As with the volume it supplements, this

        chapter discusses the first manifestations of Islam in America from the eighteenth
        century to 1975. The first US Muslims were West African Sunnis who had been
        deported through the transatlantic slave trade. Most came from Senegal, Gambia,
        and Guinea. Despite being enslaved in a Christian land, they maintained their
        faith, and evidence shows that some continued to pray, fast, give charity,
        and follow a particular diet and dress code. Their literacy was well known
        and manuscripts they wrote in Arabic have been preserved. Part of their legacy
        can still be heard in American music. After their disappearance and without
        any evidence of continuity, indigenous movements, such as the Moorish Science
        Temple of Islam and the Nation of Islam, emerged in the early 1900s. Within
        their communities, created by and built around charismatic men, they mixed
        black nationalism, new definitions of identity, and pseudo-Islamic tenets,
        often in contradiction to the most basic principles of Islam. All these were
        used to bolster mental emancipation, self-determination, economic improvement,
        and social justice.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oxfordhb\/9780199862634.013.009","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,17]],"date-time":"2014-04-17T15:27:25Z","timestamp":1397748445000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        many personalities involved, and about the conflicts and concessions that

        the landscape gardener John Claudius Loudon (1783\u20131843) received a great
        deal of correspondence from interested readers. This prompted him and the
        Encyclopaedia''s contributors to publish this supplement in 1842. Loudon and
        his colleagues had continued to study a range of rural buildings - from homes
        to farms and schools - in England and Scotland, while at the same time receiving
        architectural designs and detailed letters from North America and Australia.
        The supplement draws on this wealth of material to discuss developments in
        the use of building materials as well as innovations in design. The focus
        is on cottages, farms, pubs, schools and almshouses. Construction methods
        and furnishings are also discussed. As with the volume it supplements, this
