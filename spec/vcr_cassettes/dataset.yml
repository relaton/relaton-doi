        chapter discusses the first manifestations of Islam in America from the eighteenth
        century to 1975. The first US Muslims were West African Sunnis who had been
        deported through the transatlantic slave trade. Most came from Senegal, Gambia,
        and Guinea. Despite being enslaved in a Christian land, they maintained their
        faith, and evidence shows that some continued to pray, fast, give charity,
        and follow a particular diet and dress code. Their literacy was well known
        and manuscripts they wrote in Arabic have been preserved. Part of their legacy
        can still be heard in American music. After their disappearance and without
        any evidence of continuity, indigenous movements, such as the Moorish Science
        Temple of Islam and the Nation of Islam, emerged in the early 1900s. Within
        their communities, created by and built around charismatic men, they mixed
        black nationalism, new definitions of identity, and pseudo-Islamic tenets,
        often in contradiction to the most basic principles of Islam. All these were
        used to bolster mental emancipation, self-determination, economic improvement,
        and social justice.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oxfordhb\/9780199862634.013.009","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,17]],"date-time":"2014-04-17T15:27:25Z","timestamp":1397748445000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        many personalities involved, and about the conflicts and concessions that

        the success of his richly illustrated Encyclopaedia of Cottage, Farm, and
        Villa Architecture and Furniture (1833), which is also reissued in this series,
        the landscape gardener John Claudius Loudon (1783\u20131843) received a great
        deal of correspondence from interested readers. This prompted him and the
        Encyclopaedia''s contributors to publish this supplement in 1842. Loudon and
        his colleagues had continued to study a range of rural buildings - from homes
        to farms and schools - in England and Scotland, while at the same time receiving
        architectural designs and detailed letters from North America and Australia.
        The supplement draws on this wealth of material to discuss developments in
        the use of building materials as well as innovations in design. The focus
        is on cottages, farms, pubs, schools and almshouses. Construction methods
        and furnishings are also discussed. As with the volume it supplements, this

        book offers a detailed biography of ten influential American popular love
        ballads, from \u201cBill Bailey, Won\u2019t You Please Come Home\u201d (1902)
        to \u201cYou Made Me Love You\u201d (1913). These became models for over forty
        years of great songs. In an innovative combination, they fused jazziness with
        intimate, personal qualities that were further revealed in the late 1920s
        with the advent of the torch song genre\u2014and microphone crooning techniques,
        which linked them to the lullaby. They were a product of collective innovation
        by both famous figures like Irving Berlin and forgotten songwriters, including
        women and those from minority groups. Further, the performers, arrangers,
        and publishers changed the original songs, in a process similar to the oral
        folk music tradition. All these songs were fit into narratives\u2014movies,
        plays, histories, scholarly works, and literature\u2014which continually redefined
        them. The book analyzes the songs and how they were interpreted, featuring
        full music scores, musical excerpts, and forty illustrations. This study strips
        away the myths behind the creation of these ten core songs, revealing the
        even more colorful true stories. The discussion proposes a fresh definition
        for the torch song, as one making the listener aware of the flame of love
        within their heart. It includes an introduction to the New York music publishing
        industry, Tin Pan Alley, and operates as a listening guide and viewing companion
        for the Great American Songbook. Through the stories of individual songs,
        this history supplies a panoramic collage of the golden age of American classic
        pop.<\/p>","DOI":"10.14325\/mississippi\/9781496834294.001.0001","type":"edited-book","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,20]],"date-time":"2022-01-20T15:11:34Z","timestamp":1642691494000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["My

        chapter discusses the first manifestations of Islam in America from the eighteenth
        century to 1975. The first US Muslims were West African Sunnis who had been
        deported through the transatlantic slave trade. Most came from Senegal, Gambia,
        and Guinea. Despite being enslaved in a Christian land, they maintained their
        faith, and evidence shows that some continued to pray, fast, give charity,
        and follow a particular diet and dress code. Their literacy was well known
        and manuscripts they wrote in Arabic have been preserved. Part of their legacy
        can still be heard in American music. After their disappearance and without
        any evidence of continuity, indigenous movements, such as the Moorish Science
        Temple of Islam and the Nation of Islam, emerged in the early 1900s. Within
        their communities, created by and built around charismatic men, they mixed
        black nationalism, new definitions of identity, and pseudo-Islamic tenets,
        often in contradiction to the most basic principles of Islam. All these were
        used to bolster mental emancipation, self-determination, economic improvement,
        and social justice.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oxfordhb\/9780199862634.013.009","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,17]],"date-time":"2014-04-17T15:27:25Z","timestamp":1397748445000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        the landscape gardener John Claudius Loudon (1783\u20131843) received a great
        deal of correspondence from interested readers. This prompted him and the
        Encyclopaedia''s contributors to publish this supplement in 1842. Loudon and
        his colleagues had continued to study a range of rural buildings - from homes
        to farms and schools - in England and Scotland, while at the same time receiving
        architectural designs and detailed letters from North America and Australia.
        The supplement draws on this wealth of material to discuss developments in
        the use of building materials as well as innovations in design. The focus
        is on cottages, farms, pubs, schools and almshouses. Construction methods

        book offers a detailed biography of ten influential American popular love
        ballads, from \u201cBill Bailey, Won\u2019t You Please Come Home\u201d (1902)
        to \u201cYou Made Me Love You\u201d (1913). These became models for over forty
        years of great songs. In an innovative combination, they fused jazziness with
        intimate, personal qualities that were further revealed in the late 1920s
        with the advent of the torch song genre\u2014and microphone crooning techniques,
        which linked them to the lullaby. They were a product of collective innovation
        by both famous figures like Irving Berlin and forgotten songwriters, including
        women and those from minority groups. Further, the performers, arrangers,
        and publishers changed the original songs, in a process similar to the oral
        folk music tradition. All these songs were fit into narratives\u2014movies,
        plays, histories, scholarly works, and literature\u2014which continually redefined
        them. The book analyzes the songs and how they were interpreted, featuring
        full music scores, musical excerpts, and forty illustrations. This study strips
        away the myths behind the creation of these ten core songs, revealing the
        even more colorful true stories. The discussion proposes a fresh definition
        for the torch song, as one making the listener aware of the flame of love
        within their heart. It includes an introduction to the New York music publishing
        industry, Tin Pan Alley, and operates as a listening guide and viewing companion
        for the Great American Songbook. Through the stories of individual songs,
        this history supplies a panoramic collage of the golden age of American classic
        pop.<\/p>","DOI":"10.14325\/mississippi\/9781496834294.001.0001","type":"edited-book","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,20]],"date-time":"2022-01-20T15:11:34Z","timestamp":1642691494000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["My
