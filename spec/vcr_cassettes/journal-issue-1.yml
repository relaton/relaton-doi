        support) or spatial relational changes (such as joining and separation). On
        the contrary, all main verb distinctions within the placement domain can be
        described in terms of agentive control settings between the Figure and agentive
        entities (e.g., the Agent, other persons). In Hungarian, only events with
        continuous agentive control along the motion trajectory are described as either
        \u2018putting\u2019 or \u2018taking\u2019, and only events where the Figure

        chapter explores the expression of placement (or <jats:italic>Goal-oriented<\/jats:italic>)
        and removal (or <jats:italic>Source-oriented<\/jats:italic>) events by speakers
        of Polish (a West Slavic language). Its aim is to investigate the hypothesis
        known as \u2018Source\/Goal asymmetry\u2019 according to which languages tend
        to favor the expression of Goals (e.g., <jats:italic>into, onto<\/jats:italic>)
        and to encode them more systematically and in a more fine-grained way than
        Sources (e.g., <jats:italic>from, out of<\/jats:italic>). The study provides
        both evidence and counter-evidence for Source\/Goal asymmetry. On the one
        hand, it shows that Polish speakers use a greater variety of verbs to convey
        Manner and\/or mode of manipulation in the expression of placement, encoding
        such events in a more fine-grained manner than removal events. The expression
        of placement is also characterized by a greater variety of verb prefixes conveying
        Path and prepositional phrases (including prepositions and case markers) conveying
        Ground. On the other hand, the study reveals that Polish speakers attend to
        Sources as often as to Goals, revealing no evidence for an attentional bias
        toward the endpoints of events.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1075\/tsl.100.20kop","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,23]],"date-time":"2014-03-23T22:21:38Z","timestamp":1395613298000},"page":"327-348","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":["Semantic

        this study investigates the semantic associations between vision, hearing,

        8 phyla. The study, based on first hand data, combines synchronic and diachronic

        senses (Viberg 1984), the auditory modality prevails crosslinguistically as
        far as transfield associations between the hearing sense and mental perception
        are concerned. Vision comes next, then prehension. Furthermore the data invalidates

        how speakers of the two languages choose to talk about these events. Finally,
        the paper focuses on two aspects that seem to be crucial in the description
        of these events (1) the role of force dynamics: both languages distinguish
        between different degrees of force, causality, and intentionality, and (2)
        the influence of the verb-framed lexicalisation pattern. Data come from six

        paper explores the linguistic encoding of placement and removal events in
        Jahai (Austroasiatic, Malay Peninsula) on the basis of descriptions from a
        video elicitation task. It outlines the structural characteristics of the
        descriptions and isolates semantically a set of situation types that find
        expression in lexical opposites: (1) putting\/taking, (2) inserting\/extracting,
        (3) dressing\/undressing, and (4) placing\/removing one\u2019s body parts.
        All involve deliberate and controlled placing\/removing of a solid Figure
        object in relation to a Ground which is not a human recipient. However, they
        differ as to the identity of and physical relationship between Figure and
        Ground. The data also provide evidence of variation in how semantic roles
        are mapped onto syntactic constituents: in most situation types, Agent, Figure
        and Ground associate with particular constituent NPs, but some placement events
        are described with semantically specialised verbs encoding the Figure and
        even the Ground.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1075\/tsl.100.05bur","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,23]],"date-time":"2014-03-23T22:21:38Z","timestamp":1395613298000},"page":"21-36","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["The
