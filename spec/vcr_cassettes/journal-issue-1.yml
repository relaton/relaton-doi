        Construction Grammar, like other construction grammars, treats constructions
        as pairings of form and meaning, and like typology, uses meaning as the basis
        for crosslinguistic comparison. Semantic or linguistic relativity poses a
        potential problem for Radical Construction Grammar, because it hypothesizes
        that meaning varies depending on the formal constructions used. This chapter
        argues that arguments for semantic relativity contain several hidden assumptions
        which are implausible: contrast across languages implies contrast within a
        language; semantic analyses always involve monosemy, not polysemy; linguistic
        analyses must avoid syntagmatic semantic redundancy; and one can only posit
        a relativistic analysis of one part of a construction by assuming a universal
        analysis of another part of the construction (the Semantic Uncertainty Principle).
        Instead, grammatical differences are the result of different patterns of semantic
        extension and grammaticalization, and semantic change eventually reasserts
        the universal semantics of particular situation types.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/acprof:oso\/9780198299554.003.0003","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2007,9,18]],"date-time":"2007-09-18T09:54:04Z","timestamp":1190109244000},"page":"108-131","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Syntactic
