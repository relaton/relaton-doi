        who has been convicted and is unlawfully at large following his conviction.
        The second part of this chapter considers the important topic of extradition
        offences. These are the offences for which extradition from the UK can be
        granted. Whilst there are some similarities with the way in which extradition
        offences were defined in Part III of the EA 1989, the scheme established by
        the EA 2003 contains a number of significant differences.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780199298990.003.0002","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,1]],"date-time":"2023-11-01T02:51:41Z","timestamp":1698807101000},"page":"17-34","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Liability

        defendants do not wish to contest the request for their extradition and want
        to return as quickly as possible to the requesting state. The EA 1870 did
        not provide any mechanism for expedited return. This was recognized as undesirable
        in 1982 by the Home Office Working Party on Extradition, and it made appropriate
        recommendations in its Report. In the EA 1989 Parliament introduced a simplified
        procedure in s 14 and para 9 of Sch 1 by which the defendant could waive his
        rights under the Act. Appropriate forms of consent were contained in the Schedule
        to the Magistrates Court (Extradition) Rules 1989. However, these provisions
        gave rise to some difficulties in their application, and the European Union
        Extradition Regulations 2002 introduced significant changes to the procedure
        for consenting to return in EU cases.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780199298990.003.0011","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,1]],"date-time":"2023-11-01T02:51:41Z","timestamp":1698807101000},"page":"181-188","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Consent
