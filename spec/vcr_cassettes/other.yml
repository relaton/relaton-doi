        you favor democratic socialism? If you believe strongly in workplace democracy
        and are willing to mandate it, or if you attach a high priority to low levels
        of income and wealth inequality, then possibly yes. Otherwise, you might reasonably
        prefer to opt for social democratic capitalism, with which we have extensive
        experience, rather than take a chance on a system that is, to this point in
        history, untested. Over the coming half century, social democratic capitalism
        is likely to be the dominant socioeconomic model in the world\u2019s rich
        democratic nations. This model might evolve to include more economic democracy
        and more public ownership of firms, which would bring it closer to what contemporary
        democratic socialists would like. But even if there is no such evolution,
        that might be okay. Social democratic capitalism isn\u2019t perfect, but it
        is quite good.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780197636800.003.0017","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,19]],"date-time":"2022-05-19T09:25:55Z","timestamp":1652952355000},"page":"163-170","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Would
