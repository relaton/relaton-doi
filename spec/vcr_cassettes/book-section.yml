        thesis presents planning approaches adapted for high spatial resolution data
        from remote sensing and evaluate whether such approaches can enhance the provision
        of ecosystem services from forests. The presented methods are compared with
        conventional, stand-level methods. The main focus lies on the planning concept
        of dynamic treatment units (DTU), where treatments in small units for modelling
        ecosystem processes and forest management are clustered spatiotemporally to
        form treatment units realistic in practical forestry. The methodological foundation
        of the thesis is mainly airborne laser scanning data (raster cells 12.5x12.5
        m2), different optimization methods and the forest decision support system
        Heureka. Paper I demonstrates a mixed-integer programming model for DTU planning,
        and the results highlight the economic advances of clustering harvests. Paper
        II and III presents an addition to a DTU heuristic from the literature and
        further evaluates its performance. Results show that direct modelling of fixed
        costs for harvest operations can improve plans and that DTU planning enhances
        the economic outcome of forestry. The higher spatial resolution of data in
        the DTU approach enables the planning model to assign management with higher
        precision than if stand-based planning is applied. Paper IV evaluates whether
        this phenomenon is also valid for ecological values. Here, an approach adapted
        for cell-level data is compared to a schematic approach, dealing with stand-level
        data, for the purpose of allocating retention patches. The evaluation of economic
        and ecological values indicate that high spatial resolution data and an adapted
        planning approach increased the ecological values, while differences in economy
        were small. In conclusion, the studies in this thesis demonstrate how forest
        planning can utilize high spatial resolution data from remote sensing, and
        the results suggest that there is a potential to increase the overall provision
        of ecosystem services if such methods are applied.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.54612\/a.4h25q0pofl","type":"monograph","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,10]],"date-time":"2023-02-10T09:42:24Z","timestamp":1676022144000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Forest
