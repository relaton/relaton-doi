        chapter offers an overview of the experiences of the four major cultural groups
        within the borders of modern Alaska: Eskimos (Yup\u2019ik, Inupiat), Aleuts,
        Athabaskans, and the Haida and Tlingit Indians. After describing the nature
        of precontact Alaskan cultures, the chapter describes the era of Russian rule
        (dominated by the trade in sea otters, the violent subjugation of the Aleuts,
        and the advent of Russian Orthodox missionaries), the American purchase and
        its aftermath, the Second World War, and the tumultuous events accompanying
        the admission of Alaska to statehood in 1958. Throughout their encounter with
        outsiders, the indigenous peoples of Alaska have struggled with the introduction
        of new diseases, assaults on their subsistence traditions, and struggles over
        land ownership. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (1971) has ushered
        in a new period of improvement even though the state\u2019s Native people
        continue to struggle with the ongoing effects of colonialism.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oxfordhb\/9780199858897.013.31","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,11]],"date-time":"2016-04-11T09:48:21Z","timestamp":1460368101000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Alaska"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Rosita","family":"Kaah\u00e1ni
