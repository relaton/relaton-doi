        chapter examines the sacramental theology of Augustine of Hippo, the great
        Western Church Father who emphasized the mystery of God and the fruit of love,
        and identified sacraments as \u201cvisible sign that connect us to the mystery
        of our saving God.\u201d Baptism was to occur only once in a believer\u2019s
        life and marked not only the entrance of the believer into the Church but
        also the believer\u2019s identity with the death and resurrection of Jesus
        Christ. Augustine encouraged infant baptism and considered marriage and ordination
        to be sacraments as well. In addition, for Augustine, \u201cthe Eucharist
        is the summit of sacramental theology because it is so obviously and closely
        connected to the Incarnate Christ himself and because it is a visible sign
        that connects us to the mystery of salvation in Christ which is fulfilled
        in love.\u201d Augustine\u2019s work on the sacraments was in many ways seminal
        and has continued to influence Christian sacramental theology ever since.\n<\/p>","DOI":"10.18574\/nyu\/9780814724323.003.0004","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,24]],"date-time":"2018-09-24T08:07:24Z","timestamp":1537776444000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["St.

        Introduction sets the context of the project within scholarly suspicion that
        demons are an archaic holdover from the Christianity of Augustine\u2019s historical
        setting. It proceeds to suggest that before demons are dismissed in this manner,
        a greater effort should be made to understand what Augustine means in the
        first place when he speaks of demons, and that this is the principle goal
        of the work as a whole. Following an overview of the chapter structure of
        the work, some notes on sources are offered to provide additional context
        for the project. First, the principal works of Augustine\u2019s consulted
        throughout the study are identified, with particular attention paid to the
        City of God. After this, the principle sources Augustine himself used for
        his demonology are highlighted, especially Apuleius of Madaura and Porphyry
        of Tyre.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780192846037.003.0001","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,26]],"date-time":"2021-10-26T06:27:33Z","timestamp":1635229653000},"page":"1-15","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Introduction"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Gregory

        concluding chapter considers the import of Augustine\u2019s religious or sacramental
        understanding of demons presented in the work as a whole, against the backdrop
        of the suspicion that Augustine\u2019s demonology is an obsolete aspect of
        his thought, remote in one way or another from present-day concerns. This
        import is articulated first in terms of the theology of atonement and the
        specific question of ransoming the devil, which suggests that restoration
        of humanity\u2019s relationship with God simultaneously requires freedom from
        the fallen social, political, and religious powers that enslave them. The
        risk of missing this is then explored briefly in an assessment of Charles
        Mathewes\u2019 rejection of demons in his Augustinian and Arendtian \u2018political
        ontology.\u2019 This assessment makes it clear that dismissing demons as irrelevant
        to or undermining the socio-political order threatens to construct exactly
        the demonic idols, the gods of the nations, about which Augustine is most
        concerned.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780192846037.003.0008","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,20]],"date-time":"2021-10-20T21:30:12Z","timestamp":1634765412000},"page":"222-232","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Conclusion"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Gregory
