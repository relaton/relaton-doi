        Augustine, angels became demons in their failure to love God above all. This
        chapter gives an overview of that fall, beginning with Augustine\u2019s understanding
        of evil as pride\u2019s apostasy from God, moving on to examine two issues
        that confront him concerning the devil\u2019s fall. The first is the question
        of whether that fall can have any cause, which is explored in terms of Augustine\u2019s
        basic commitment to the non-competitive relationship between the created will
        and the God that creates and empowers it. The second issue is Augustine\u2019s
        understanding of when and in what conditions the devil fell, and the development
        of Augustine\u2019s conviction that all angels must have been established
        in the good at their creation. What both discussions clarify, however, is
        that these issues arise because of how difficult it is to maintain the logical
        consequences of the demons\u2019 lack of animal bodies. This fundamental difference
        of embodiment between demons and humans is made clear in Augustine\u2019s
        treatment of the story of the fall of Adam and Eve, where the comparison of
        the fall of the angels to the human fall reveals a crucial component of Augustine\u2019s
        demonology: demons must assume some kind of embodiment in order to interact
        with humans in history.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780192846037.003.0003","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,20]],"date-time":"2021-10-20T19:39:19Z","timestamp":1634758759000},"page":"53-93","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        chapter examines the sacramental theology of Augustine of Hippo, the great
        Western Church Father who emphasized the mystery of God and the fruit of love,
        and identified sacraments as \u201cvisible sign that connect us to the mystery
        of our saving God.\u201d Baptism was to occur only once in a believer\u2019s
        life and marked not only the entrance of the believer into the Church but
        also the believer\u2019s identity with the death and resurrection of Jesus
        Christ. Augustine encouraged infant baptism and considered marriage and ordination
        to be sacraments as well. In addition, for Augustine, \u201cthe Eucharist
        is the summit of sacramental theology because it is so obviously and closely
        connected to the Incarnate Christ himself and because it is a visible sign
        that connects us to the mystery of salvation in Christ which is fulfilled
        in love.\u201d Augustine\u2019s work on the sacraments was in many ways seminal
        and has continued to influence Christian sacramental theology ever since.\n<\/p>","DOI":"10.18574\/nyu\/9780814724323.003.0004","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,24]],"date-time":"2018-09-24T08:07:24Z","timestamp":1537776444000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["St.
