        Augustine, angels became demons in their failure to love God above all. This
        chapter gives an overview of that fall, beginning with Augustine\u2019s understanding
        of evil as pride\u2019s apostasy from God, moving on to examine two issues
        that confront him concerning the devil\u2019s fall. The first is the question
        of whether that fall can have any cause, which is explored in terms of Augustine\u2019s
        basic commitment to the non-competitive relationship between the created will
        and the God that creates and empowers it. The second issue is Augustine\u2019s
        understanding of when and in what conditions the devil fell, and the development
        of Augustine\u2019s conviction that all angels must have been established
        in the good at their creation. What both discussions clarify, however, is
        that these issues arise because of how difficult it is to maintain the logical
        consequences of the demons\u2019 lack of animal bodies. This fundamental difference
        of embodiment between demons and humans is made clear in Augustine\u2019s
        treatment of the story of the fall of Adam and Eve, where the comparison of
        the fall of the angels to the human fall reveals a crucial component of Augustine\u2019s
        demonology: demons must assume some kind of embodiment in order to interact
        with humans in history.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780192846037.003.0003","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,20]],"date-time":"2021-10-20T19:39:19Z","timestamp":1634758759000},"page":"53-93","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        understanding of demons presented in the work as a whole, against the backdrop
        of the suspicion that Augustine\u2019s demonology is an obsolete aspect of
        his thought, remote in one way or another from present-day concerns. This
        import is articulated first in terms of the theology of atonement and the
        specific question of ransoming the devil, which suggests that restoration
        of humanity\u2019s relationship with God simultaneously requires freedom from
        the fallen social, political, and religious powers that enslave them. The
        risk of missing this is then explored briefly in an assessment of Charles
        Mathewes\u2019 rejection of demons in his Augustinian and Arendtian \u2018political
        ontology.\u2019 This assessment makes it clear that dismissing demons as irrelevant

        of the work as a whole. Following an overview of the chapter structure of
        the work, some notes on sources are offered to provide additional context
        for the project. First, the principal works of Augustine\u2019s consulted
        throughout the study are identified, with particular attention paid to the

        chapter considers a variety of phenomena by which demons are perceived, focusing
        upon the more wondrous or miraculous. For Augustine, demons have power only
        over bodies and appearances, not human understanding and will. This restricts
        demonic power to the natural, causal limitations of corporeal things, which
        they only know externally\u2014scientifically, as it were\u2014and not contemplatively
        in God as the angels do. It also makes it possible for the saints to resist
        them with virtue, by which demons are made the \u2018sport of angels\u2019.
        This is demonstrated by a review of a variety of demonic phenomena that appear
        in Augustine\u2019s writings including divination, prodigies, signs, temptation,
        and possession, which are analysed according to the two basic categories of
        deception and affliction. The chapter ends with a comparison of angelic and
        demonic miracles. Occasionally Augustine claims that angelic miracles have
        greater power than those of demons, but it is more essential in his work to
        differentiate them not according to their perceived power but by their meaning.
        The self-love in which they fell is the self-love to which all the works of
        demons ultimately refer and by which they are identifiable in those works.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780192846037.003.0005","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,20]],"date-time":"2021-10-20T19:13:41Z","timestamp":1634757221000},"page":"120-146","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Demonic

        chapter continues the investigation of signs and sacraments of demons in pagan
        religion and its gods, which Augustine sees as the very foundation of Rome\u2019s
        history of moral corruption. It shows what Augustine thinks is particularly
        demonic in Roman polytheism, both as it is presented most straightforwardly
        to the public and as it is understood by its most clever interpreters, chiefly
        the Platonists, Apuleius, and Porphyry. This analysis reveals that Augustine\u2019s
        demons interact with and manifest among humanity in three principal ways:
        the straightforward imitation of demonic pride, the demons\u2019 administration
        of false religion as though they were true angels, and, folding these two
        together, the promotion of religion known to be false for the sake of possessing
        other people politically. The chapter concludes with Augustine\u2019s commendation
        of ecclesial incorporation into Christ as true and good, where demonic religion
        is false and wicked, and thus as the primary means by which humanity is to

        chapter further investigates the question of demons and bodies, beginning
        with the traditional belief that demons have bodies of air which Augustine
        inherited from both Christians and philosophers. In Augustine\u2019s philosophically
        rigorous reflections upon the nature of visions, he adopts a scripturally
        prescribed reticence to speculate about the causal origins of visions that
        makes it impossible to say that the demon\u2019s aerial body is the means
        by which it appears to humans. In this way Augustine maintains a crucial ontological
        distinction between the demonic nature itself and the various miracles, possessions,
        and other phenomena by which it appears. An aerial body is not, strictly speaking,
        a historical body per se, and is instead a way of speaking about the unknowable
        methods by which demons do, in fact, appear among humans.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780192846037.003.0004","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,20]],"date-time":"2021-10-20T21:46:07Z","timestamp":1634766367000},"page":"94-119","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Demonic

        chapter establishes the creator-created, eternal-temporal distinction that
        is foundational for Augustine\u2019s theology. This distinction forms the
        basis for his reflections upon the creation account of Genesis, in which he
        attempts to locate creation of the angels. But it also defines the problem
        that the angels are to help solve, namely, how humans are to know and love
        God in the remoteness of God\u2019s eternity. For Augustine, angels are created
        wisdom, enlightened in their love of God, perfected at the beginning of their
        creation, always beholding the Father\u2019s face. As perfected intellectual
        spirits, angels possess a knowledge of creation in God that allows them to
        oversee all of creation. In this administrative role it is the angels\u2019
        responsibility to be God\u2019s external, volitional mode of providence for
        the whole cosmos, seeing in God through their ceaseless contemplation what
        ought to occur in God\u2019s creation and carrying it out as required. For
        Augustine, the primary goal of this angelic office is to testify to the incarnation
        of the Son of God, not only with miracles and theophanies, but also by working
        through human institutions, most notably in their administration of the Holy
        Scriptures themselves.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780192846037.003.0002","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,20]],"date-time":"2021-10-20T21:58:15Z","timestamp":1634767095000},"page":"16-52","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        chapter begins to consider Augustine\u2019s perception of the history of Rome
        and its false gods as the history of the demons themselves, as the most profound
        works of demons are not individual miracles but the religious institutions
        of the earthly city. The demons\u2019 fall away from God produces a rival
        symbolic order to Christ\u2019s angelic ministers, one which manifests in
        a corporate opposition to Christ\u2019s body. The contrary referents of the
        work of angels and demons correspond to contrary sacraments, which constitute
        contrary historical bodies: the body of Christ, which is identified with the

        the body of the devil, the exemplar of which, for Augustine, is pagan Rome.
        Augustine\u2019s understanding of the earthly city is informed by a concept
        of disordered, demonic sacraments, and the paradigm for this is his discussion
        of Hermetic \u2018god-making\u2019. In this paradigm, human myths and artefacts
        manifest a demonic sacramental regime when they are elevated to divine status

        book ventures to describe Augustine of Hippo\u2019s understanding of demons,
        including the theology, angelology, and anthropology that contextualize it.
        Demons are, for Augustine as for the Psalmist (95:5 LXX) and the Apostle (1
        Cor. 10:20), the \u2018gods of the nations\u2019. This means that Augustine\u2019s
        demons are best understood neither when they are \u2018spiritualized\u2019
        as personifications of psychological struggles nor in terms of materialist
        contagions that undergird a superstitious moralism. Rather, because the gods
        of the nations are the paradigm of demonic power and influence over humanity,
        Augustine sees the Christian\u2019s moral struggle against them within broader
        questions of social bonds, cultural form, popular opinion, philosophical investigation,
        liturgical movement, and so forth. In a word, Augustine\u2019s demons have
        a <italic>religious<\/italic> significance, particularly in its Augustinian
        sense of bonds and duties between persons, and between persons and that which
        is divine. Demons are a highly integrated component of his broader theology,
        rooted in his conception of angels as the ministers of all creation under
        God, and informed by the doctrine of evil as privation and his understanding
        of the fall; they take shape in his thoughts on human embodiment, desire,
        visions, and the limits of human knowledge; and they manifest most profoundly
        in his ecclesiology, through his theology of sacraments and religious incorporation,
        and its engagement with traditional paganism and its most intelligent supporters,
        the Platonists. As false mediators, demons are mediated by false religion,
        the body of the devil, which Augustine opposes with an appeal to the true
        mediator, Christ, and the true religion of his body, the church.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780192846037.001.0001","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,20]],"date-time":"2021-10-20T21:31:10Z","timestamp":1634765470000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Fallen
