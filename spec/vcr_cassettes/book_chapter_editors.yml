        perspectives of musical talent from the psychological, musical, and educational
        fields, Kindling the Spark is the only single sourcebook that defines musical
        talent and provides practical strategies for identifying and nurturing it.
        Joanne Haroutounian uses her experience as teacher, researcher, and parent
        to clarify central issues concerning talent recognition and development in
        a way that will easily appeal to a wide audience. The book describes the different
        stages of development in musical training, including guidelines for finding
        a suitable teacher at different levels, social and psychological aspects that
        impact musical training, and research on talent development by ages and stages
        from infancy and preschool years through the teen years. An important feature
        of the book are \"sparkler exercises\" designed to provoke observable talent
        behavior in home, school, and studio settings. The book also includes an Appendix
        of Resources which lists books, media, organizations, and specialized schools
        that offer additional information on musical talent, identification, and development.
        For music educators in both public school and private studio settings--as
        well as for parents and their musically inclined children--Kindling the Spark
        provides an invaluable summary of the research on talent and a wealth of resources
        for developing it.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780195129489.001.0001","type":"edited-book","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,10]],"date-time":"2020-11-10T18:38:39Z","timestamp":1605033519000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":21,"title":["Kindling
